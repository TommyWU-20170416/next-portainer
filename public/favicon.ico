The file /my-next-app/my-next-app/public/favicon.ico should contain the binary data for the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary data directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image file and place it in that location.

If you need a placeholder, you can create a simple favicon using an online favicon generator or use an existing favicon image. Once you have the favicon image, save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory. 

This file is intentionally left blank.
